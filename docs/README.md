# MethodKit Next Starter Kit Docs

The `docs` directory is a place to put information about how your project works, what tooling you use, and why.

This starter kit provides some intitial documentation, giving an overview of recommended tooling and practices, as well as explanations of how the decisions that were made were arrived at.

Users are encouraged to continue to use the `docs` folder going forward for any sort of internal documentation that may be needed to bring new team members on board, explain complex architecture or functionality, etc.
